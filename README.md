# Restaurant Table iOS Application - Swift

This simple iOS Application written in Swift 3 is to practise how to create a table, show details of each items in a table, and add new item into the table.

This project is submitted as the final project of iOS programming class taught at EPITA engineering school. 
Requirement can be found [here](https://github.com/l225li/tableViewProject_Swift/blob/master/ADVANCED-IOS-PROGRAMMING-EPITA-Winter-2017.pdf).

**For the purpose of the project, [`ViewController.swift`](https://github.com/l225li/tableViewProject_Swift/blob/master/RestaurantTable/ViewController.swift) acts like a `TableViewController.swift`.**
